=== Description

This extension defines a mechanism for defining descriptor layouts in which
bindings can be used to reserve space for other descriptor types via
a list of potential bindings accompanying the descriptor set layout.

This extension also defines a mechanism for allocating descriptor pools, and therefore
descriptor sets in host memory only.

This allows the application to create descriptor sets with mutable bindings,
allowing for one large descriptor set to be used, rather than mutliple smaller sets.
