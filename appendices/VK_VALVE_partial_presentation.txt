=== Description

This device extension extends flink:vkQueuePresentKHR, from the
`<<VK_KHR_swapchain>>` extension, and the functionality
provided by `<<VK_KHR_incremental_present>>` to also allow a new
set of exclusive regions for each image that will be updated as well
as an offset into the source swapchain image(s).

=== Issues

1) Should we call the dirty/changed regions pDamageRegions, pDirtyRegions
or something else?
